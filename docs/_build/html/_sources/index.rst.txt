Ideas
-----
* Parallelize the calculations in time (i.e. calculate each index simultaneously) to speed up.
* Replace the Numpy arrays with h5py datasets, which can store much larger files locally.
* Visualization - Use matplotlib to export heat map of field intensity in space
* Create a VectorField class that can be used for non-plane wave simulations

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
